# Description

The code is almost the same as in the last example, but the low-level
packages have been "sparkified". As a result, the whole code is
almost fully proved.

To launch the prover, just execute the following:

	make prove

It will lauch `gnatprove`:

	gnatprove -P main.gpr

You'll note that some packages are not proved. 
It's because they use some Ada features not compatible with SPARK and therefore
*spark_mode* is off.

The report generated by `gnatprove` is in build/gnatprove/gnatprove.out. It should
indicates that 14 run-time checks were made, 13 are proved, one is unproved:

    SPARK Analysis results    Total   Flow   Provers   Justified   Unproved
    ...
    Run-time Checks           14      .      13        .           1

To visualise which checks are proved and to have a more detailed report, you
can launche `gnatprove` with `--report=all`:

	gnatprove -P main.gpr --report=all
